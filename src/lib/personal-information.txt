About Me:
Hi! I&apos;m a tech enthusiast currently diving into the world of web
development. I&apos;m learning full-stack development through IT trade
school and self-study, focusing on modern tools like React, Next.js,
TypeScript, Node.js. While I&apos;m still early in my journey, I&apos;m
excited about building useful applications and growing as a developer.
Outside of coding, I love listening to music and watching movies.
Radiohead is my favorite band and David Fincher is my favorite director.
But my real passion is cooking, especially when I&apos;m preparing meals
for my wife. I find joy in creating something special in the kitchen for
someone I care about. It&apos;s my way of showing care and creativity,
just like I hope to do through programming.

Intro:
Hello, I'm Scheff. a full-stack developer in training. 
I learn by building sites & apps, focusing primarily on the React/Next.js ecosystem and Node.js backend development. 
Currently exploring AI agent development too.
